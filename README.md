Speeding up the discovery of red links from Wikipedia articles and the creation of articles for them.

A bit Stackoverflow style perhaps... in the way that new and unanswered questions are shown to users.

What if we could connect this with stackoverflow and other collective intelligence communities who would love to respond (create) to these questions (articles needing creating)?

What if we could create reasonable non-fake good initial articles using Perplexity, Bard, ChatGPT or Claude?
